jQuery recurranceinput widget
=============================

Jquery plugin widget which support the definition of complex recurrence
rulesets based on RFC5545, the iCalendar standard.

The recurrence rule string, generated by this package, should be directly usable
in ics calendar files. It was developed for the plone.event PLIP10886 and is
used there to define python-dateutil rrulestr instances.

Features
--------

* The recurrence widget supports most of the options of the iCalendar RRULE
  as well as EXDATE and RDATE. 
* It supports internationalization.
* It supports predetermined recurrence rules, so called "templates".

Non-Features
------------

This widget does not support all features of RRULE's. For example:

* It does not support recurrence on smaller than daily basis.
* In RRULE'se end-dates can end either be in local time or in UTC. This widget
  only supports UTC, which means the start and end dates of the event as a
  whole, when exported may not be in local time. They must either specify
  a timezone or be in UTC. If the RRULE fed to the widget is in local time,
  this will be made into UTC with no timezone translation.
* Any parameters will be ignored and stripped on saving the rule.


Known bugs
----------

* If a disabled item is the last on the list it will become invisible. This is
  only present with the test_server.py.


To Do
-----

High priority:

* 100% code coverage from tests (currently 97%).

Medium priority:

* The human readable output should probably be done directly from the RRULE and
  not by using the form i18n, to improve the grammar and rule support.
* Make it possible to change the order of the fields as a part of the i18n.
  (jQuery templates)?

Low priority:

* Support more obscure RFC5545 options.


Developer information
---------------------

To test, demo or develop jquery.recurrenceinput locally you need to run a
local XML-RPC server, in the test_server.py script.

This server requires the dateutil module, so you must install it first.
Here are some examples of how to do this, depending on your platform:

Debian/Ubuntu:

    $ sudo apt-get install python-dateutil
    
A non-system Python 2 with setuptools or distribute installed:

    $ <pathtopython>/easy_install python-dateutil==1.5
    

The demo/input.html document contains basic usecases and can be used when
developing on this widget. For these to work you either need to have them on a
webserver, or you need to tell your web-browser to allow Ajax loading from your
local hard drive.

In Firefox you allow this by going to about:config and setting 
`security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy` to `false`.

In Chrome and Chromium you allow this by starting Chrome with
`--allow-file-access-from-files` as a parameter.

You also need to run the tests. These are located in tests/tests.js, and use
the QUnit test framework. You run them by opening tests/test.html in the
browser. The same issue with allowing Ajax from the local hard drive is in
effect for the tests as well.

In the `tests` directory there is also a copy of jslint.js, for easy access.
To run these you need to install a JavaScript engine, such as
Rhino or SpiderMonkey. You then run it with::

    $ js tests/jslint.js <file>
 
The following files should be jslinted::

    src/jquery.recurrenceinput.js
    src/tests.js

To keep the Coverage tests updated you need to install jscoverage 
( http://siliconforks.com/jscoverage/ ). You then keep the coverage code
updated by running::

    jscoverage src/ coverage/

To run the coverage tests you go to
http://localhost:8000/coverage/jscoverage.html?/tests/coveragetest.html
